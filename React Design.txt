Rather than looping through an entire 2D array every time a node is clicked,
	store everything in a dictionary by ID. ID should be where it would
	have been positioned in a 2D array so we can still easily access
	neighbours.
Could do an initial runthrough and populate a neighbour object for each node
	on page loadup. This could have 'top', 'right', 'bottom,' and 'left' 
	attributes.


Mobile first:
	Use burger for menu in top-left which slides out.
	Not enough width for navbar (causing footer issues).
	Have settings at the top, then maze below. 'Generate maze' button 
		just above maze. Possible to snap view to maze?
